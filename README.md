### Loading the Project
An Apache Server must be used to host the website as some of our javascript functions required web authentication to run.
We chose to use a program called MAMP. This can be installed from: https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/
Install this program and then clone our github repository to a location of your choosing.
Open up MAMP and click the preferences tab. Navigate to the Web Server tab.
Set Document Root to the directory you pull our gihub link to (e.g. ../CMPE-130-Project).
Now the servers will restart and when you click open start page the MAMP homepage will load. 
Click My Website and our site will show up.

### Operation  
Click on a user to encrypt every image except the ones they own.
You can share images with other users using the dropdown.
The Logout button will encrypt all images.
